   (will be created by setup script with known security issues)

2. Run Kubesec scan on the deployment and save the scan results to:
   /opt/course/12/kubesec-report.json

3. Analyze the report and identify the security issues

4. Fix the security issues to achieve a score of at least 8 points

5. Save the fixed deployment to: /opt/course/12/secure-deploy.yaml

6. Scan the fixed deployment and save results to: /opt/course/12/kubesec-fixed.json
   Verify the score is >= 8
