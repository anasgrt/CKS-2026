Context:
Your team is migrating workloads to use Pod Security Admission (PSA). You need to
configure namespace-level security and create compliant pods.

Task:
1. Create namespace 'psa-restricted' with Pod Security labels configured to:
   - Enforce the restricted security standard
   - Warn and audit at the restricted level

2. Create a pod named 'secure-pod' in namespace 'psa-restricted' that complies with
   the restricted security standard:
   - Use image: nginx:alpine
   - Ensure the pod meets all restricted PSA requirements

3. The pod should NOT have any privileged settings or host namespace access

4. Test that a non-compliant pod (e.g., running as root) gets rejected and capture the error

Save your compliant pod YAML to: /opt/course/08/pod.yaml
Save the error message from rejected pod to: /opt/course/08/rejected-error.txt
