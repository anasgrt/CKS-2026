Context:
Secrets stored in etcd should be encrypted at rest to protect sensitive data.
Configure encryption and verify it's working.

Task:
1. Create an EncryptionConfiguration at /etc/kubernetes/encryption-config.yaml
   that encrypts secrets using aescbc encryption

2. Generate an appropriate encryption key

3. Configure the kube-apiserver to use the encryption configuration

4. Wait for API server to restart

5. Create a test secret named "test-secret" to verify encryption

6. Verify the secret is encrypted in etcd (not stored in plaintext)

7. Re-encrypt all existing secrets in the cluster

Save your EncryptionConfiguration to: /opt/course/09/encryption-config.yaml
Save the etcd verification output to: /opt/course/09/verification.txt
