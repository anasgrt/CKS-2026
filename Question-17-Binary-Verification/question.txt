Context:
Binary verification is critical to ensure Kubernetes components haven't been tampered with.
Verify the integrity of cluster binaries.

Task:
1. Identify the Kubernetes version running on the cluster

2. Download the official SHA512 checksum for kubectl matching your cluster version

3. Verify the kubectl binary on the control plane node by comparing its checksum
   with the official checksum

   Save verification result to: /opt/course/17/kubectl-verify.txt

4. A suspicious kubelet binary has been found at /tmp/kubelet-suspicious
   - Download the official kubelet checksum
   - Calculate and compare the checksum of the suspicious binary

5. Document your findings:
   - Is kubectl genuine? (matches official checksum)
   - Is /tmp/kubelet-suspicious genuine or tampered?

Save checksum comparison to: /opt/course/17/kubelet-verify.txt
Save conclusion (GENUINE or TAMPERED) to: /opt/course/17/conclusion.txt
