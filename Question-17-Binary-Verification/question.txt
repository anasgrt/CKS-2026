Context:
Binary verification is critical to ensure Kubernetes components haven't been tampered with.
Verify the integrity of cluster binaries.

Task:
1. Identify the Kubernetes version running on the cluster:
   kubectl version --short
   Note the server version (e.g., v1.30.0)

2. Download the official SHA512 checksum for kubectl:
   curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.30.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha512"
   (replace v1.30.0 with your cluster version)

3. Verify the kubectl binary on the control plane node:
   - Find kubectl location: which kubectl
   - Calculate its SHA512: sha512sum $(which kubectl)
   - Compare with official checksum

   Save verification result to: /opt/course/17/kubectl-verify.txt

4. A suspicious kubelet binary has been found at /tmp/kubelet-suspicious

   a) Download official kubelet checksum:
      curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.30.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubelet.sha512"

   b) Calculate checksum of suspicious binary:
      sha512sum /tmp/kubelet-suspicious

   c) Compare with official checksum

5. Document your findings:
   - Is kubectl genuine? (matches official checksum)
   - Is /tmp/kubelet-suspicious genuine or tampered?

Save checksum comparison to: /opt/course/17/kubelet-verify.txt
Save conclusion (GENUINE or TAMPERED) to: /opt/course/17/conclusion.txt

Hint: Use 'echo "<checksum> <filename>" | sha512sum --check' for verification
