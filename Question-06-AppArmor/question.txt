Context:
An AppArmor profile has been created to restrict container file system writes.
Configure pods to use this security profile.

Task:
1. SSH to key-worker and verify the AppArmor profile 'k8s-deny-write' is loaded.
   If not loaded, load it from /etc/apparmor.d/k8s-deny-write

2. Create namespace 'apparmor-ns' if it doesn't exist

3. Create a pod named 'secured-pod' in namespace 'apparmor-ns':
   - Use image: busybox:1.36
   - Run command: sh -c "echo 'AppArmor secured!' && sleep 1h"
   - Apply the AppArmor profile 'k8s-deny-write' to the pod

4. Verify the pod is running and AppArmor is enforced by attempting to write a file
