Context:
The security team requires comprehensive audit logging to track access to sensitive
resources. You need to configure the Kubernetes API server audit logging.

Task:
1. Create an audit policy file at /etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml with these rules:
   - Log all requests to secrets at RequestResponse level
   - Log requests to pods and pods/log at Metadata level
   - Don't log requests to configmaps named "controller-leader"
   - Don't log watch requests by system:kube-proxy on endpoints/services
   - Log configmap and secret changes in kube-system namespace at Request level
   - Catch-all rule: Log everything else at Metadata level

2. Configure the kube-apiserver to enable audit logging with:
   - Audit policy file
   - Audit log path: /var/log/kubernetes/audit/audit.log
   - Max age: 8 days
   - Max size: 9 MB
   - Max backup: 3

3. Wait for the API server to restart and verify audit logs are being generated

4. Create a secret in namespace 'audit-test' and find the corresponding audit log entry
   Save that log entry to: /opt/course/14/secret-audit.log

Save your audit policy to: /opt/course/14/audit-policy.yaml
