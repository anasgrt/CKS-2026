Context:
A deployment uses multiple container images. You need to scan these images for
vulnerabilities and recommend which images are safe to use in production.

Task:
1. The following images are used in the cluster:
   - nginx:1.19
   - nginx:1.25-alpine
   - python:3.8
   - python:3.12-alpine

2. Use Trivy to scan each image for HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities

3. Save scan results:
   - /opt/course/11/nginx-1.19-scan.txt
   - /opt/course/11/nginx-1.25-alpine-scan.txt
   - /opt/course/11/python-3.8-scan.txt
   - /opt/course/11/python-3.12-alpine-scan.txt

4. Analyze the results and determine which images have fewer vulnerabilities

5. Create a file /opt/course/11/recommendations.txt containing:
   - Recommended nginx image and why
   - Recommended python image and why
   - Total count of HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities for each image

6. Update the deployment 'web-app' in namespace 'trivy-test' to use the safer images

Save your updated deployment to: /opt/course/11/updated-deployment.yaml
