Context:
A deployment is using the default ServiceAccount which has excessive permissions.
You need to create a restricted ServiceAccount and update the deployment.

Task:
1. In namespace 'secure-ns', a deployment 'insecure-app' exists using default SA

2. Create a new ServiceAccount named 'restricted-sa' that does not automount tokens

3. Create a Role named 'pod-reader' that only allows:
   - get, list on pods
   - get, list on services
   (No create, update, delete, or access to secrets)

4. Create a RoleBinding named 'restricted-sa-binding' that binds:
   - Role 'pod-reader' to ServiceAccount 'restricted-sa'

5. Update deployment 'insecure-app' to:
   - Use ServiceAccount 'restricted-sa'
   - Ensure the service account token is not mounted in the pod

6. Verify the pod cannot access the service account token

Save your manifests to:
- /opt/course/05/sa.yaml (ServiceAccount)
- /opt/course/05/role.yaml (Role)
- /opt/course/05/rolebinding.yaml (RoleBinding)
- /opt/course/05/deployment.yaml (updated deployment)
