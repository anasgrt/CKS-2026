Context:
A new namespace needs to be isolated from all network traffic by default.
Only explicitly allowed traffic should be permitted.

Task:
1. Create namespace 'isolated-ns' if it doesn't exist

2. Create a NetworkPolicy named 'default-deny-all' in namespace 'isolated-ns' that:
   - Applies to ALL pods in the namespace (use empty podSelector: {})
   - Denies ALL ingress traffic by default
   - Denies ALL egress traffic by default

3. The NetworkPolicy should have:
   - policyTypes: ["Ingress", "Egress"]
   - Empty ingress: [] and egress: [] arrays (deny all)

4. Create a test pod in the namespace and verify it cannot:
   - Receive traffic from other pods
   - Send traffic to other pods or external services

   Test with: kubectl exec -n isolated-ns <pod> -- curl <any-service>
   This should timeout or fail

5. Document what network traffic is blocked by this policy

Save your NetworkPolicy YAML to: /opt/course/01/netpol.yaml
Save test output showing blocked traffic to: /opt/course/01/test-output.txt
