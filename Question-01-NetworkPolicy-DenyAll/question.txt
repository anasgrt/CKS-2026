Context:
A new namespace needs to be isolated from all network traffic by default.
Only explicitly allowed traffic should be permitted.

Task:
1. Create namespace 'isolated-ns' if it doesn't exist

2. Create a NetworkPolicy named 'default-deny-all' in namespace 'isolated-ns' that:
   - Applies to ALL pods in the namespace
   - Denies ALL ingress traffic by default
   - Denies ALL egress traffic by default

3. Create a test pod in the namespace and verify it cannot:
   - Receive traffic from other pods
   - Send traffic to other pods or external services

4. Document what network traffic is blocked by this policy

Save your NetworkPolicy YAML to: /opt/course/01/netpol.yaml
Save test output showing blocked traffic to: /opt/course/01/test-output.txt
