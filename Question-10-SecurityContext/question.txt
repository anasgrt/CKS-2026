Context:
A pod definition needs to be hardened following security best practices.
Apply defense-in-depth security controls.

Task:
1. Create namespace 'hardened-ns' if it doesn't exist

2. Create a pod named 'hardened-pod' in namespace 'hardened-ns' with:
   - Image: nginx:alpine
   - Run as non-root user
   - Read-only root filesystem
   - Drop all capabilities (add only what's needed)
   - Privilege escalation disabled
   - RuntimeDefault seccomp profile
   - No host namespace access (hostNetwork, hostPID, hostIPC)
   - No hostPath volumes

3. Ensure the pod can run nginx successfully with the hardened settings
   (consider what writable directories nginx requires)

4. Verify the pod starts successfully and nginx is running
